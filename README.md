Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers in which we measure accurate 
weak-lensing masses for 51 of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters 
known at redshifts 0.15 ≲ z<SUB>Cl</SUB> ≲ 0.7, in order to 
calibrate X-ray and other mass proxies for cosmological cluster 
experiments. The primary aim is to improve the absolute mass calibration 
of cluster observables, currently the dominant systematic uncertainty 
for cluster count experiments. Key elements of this work are the 
rigorous quantification of systematic uncertainties, high-quality data 
reduction and photometric calibration, and the `blind' nature of the 
analysis to avoid confirmation bias. Our target clusters are drawn from 
X-ray catalogues based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and provide a 
versatile calibration sample for many aspects of cluster cosmology. We 
have acquired wide-field, high-quality imaging using the Subaru 
Telescope and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope for all 51 clusters, in at 
least three bands per cluster. For a subset of 27 clusters, we have data 
in at least five bands, allowing accurate photometric redshift estimates 
of lensed galaxies. In this paper, we describe the cluster sample and 
observations, and detail the processing of the SuprimeCam data to yield 
high-quality images suitable for robust weak-lensing shape measurements 
and precision photometry. For each cluster, we present wide-field 
three-colour optical images and maps of the weak-lensing mass 
distribution, the optical light distribution and the X-ray emission. 
These provide insights into the large-scale structure in which the 
clusters are embedded. We measure the offsets between X-ray flux 
centroids and the brightest cluster galaxies in the clusters, finding 
these to be small in general, with a median of 20 kpc. For offsets 
≲100 kpc, weak-lensing mass measurements centred on the brightest 
cluster galaxies agree well with values determined relative to the X-ray 
centroids; miscentring is therefore not a significant source of 
systematic uncertainty for our weak-lensing mass measurements. In 
accompanying papers, we discuss the key aspects of our photometric 
calibration and photometric redshift measurements (Kelly et al.), and 
measure cluster masses using two methods, including a novel Bayesian 
weak-lensing approach that makes full use of the photometric redshift 
probability distributions for individual background galaxies (Applegate 
et al.). In subsequent papers, we will incorporate these weak-lensing 
mass measurements into a self-consistent framework to simultaneously 
determine cluster scaling relations and cosmological parameters.

Abstract: We present improved methods for using stars found in astronomical 
exposures to calibrate both star and galaxy colours as well as to adjust 
the instrument flat-field. By developing a spectroscopic model for the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar locus in colour-colour space, 
synthesizing an expected stellar locus, and simultaneously solving for 
all unknown zero-points when fitting to the instrumental locus, we 
increase the calibration accuracy of stellar locus matching. We also use 
a new combined technique to estimate improved flat-field models for the 
Subaru SuprimeCam camera, forming `star flats' based on the magnitudes 
of stars observed in multiple positions or through comparison with 
available measurements in the SDSS catalogue. These techniques yield 
galaxy magnitudes with reliable colour calibration (≲0.01-0.02 mag 
accuracy) that enable us to estimate photometric redshift probability 
distributions without spectroscopic training samples. We test the 
accuracy of our photometric redshifts using spectroscopic redshifts 
z<SUB>s</SUB> for ˜5000 galaxies in 27cluster fields with at least 
five bands of photometry, as well as galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution 
Survey (COSMOS) field, finding σ((z<SUB>p</SUB> - 
z<SUB>s</SUB>)/(1 + z<SUB>s</SUB>)) ≈ 0.03 for the most probable 
redshift z<SUB>p</SUB>. We show that the full posterior probability 
distributions for the redshifts of galaxies with five-band photometry 
exhibit good agreement with redshifts estimated from thirty-band 
photometry in the COSMOS field. The growth of shear with increasing 
distance behind each galaxy cluster shows the expected redshift-distance 
relation for a flat Λ cold dark matter (Λ-CDM) cosmology. 
Photometric redshifts and calibrated colours are used in subsequent 
papers to measure the masses of 51 galaxy clusters from their weak 
gravitational shear and determine improved cosmological constraints. We 
make our PYTHON code for stellar locus matching publicly available at 
http://big-macs-calibrate.googlecode.com; the code requires only input 
catalogues and filter transmission functions.

Abstract: We report weak-lensing masses for 51 of the most X-ray luminous galaxy 
clusters known. This cluster sample, introduced earlier in this series 
of papers, spans redshifts 0.15 ≲ z<SUB>cl</SUB> ≲ 0.7, and is 
well suited to calibrate mass proxies for current cluster cosmology 
experiments. Cluster masses are measured with a standard `colour-cut' 
lensing method from three-filter photometry of each field. Additionally, 
for 27 cluster fields with at least five-filter photometry, we measure 
high-accuracy masses using a new method that exploits all information 
available in the photometric redshift posterior probability 
distributions of individual galaxies. Using simulations based on the 
COSMOS-30 catalogue, we demonstrate control of systematic biases in the 
mean mass of the sample with this method, from photometric redshift 
biases and associated uncertainties, to better than 3 per cent. In 
contrast, we show that the use of single-point estimators in place of 
the full photometric redshift posterior distributions can lead to 
significant redshift-dependent biases on cluster masses. The performance 
of our new photometric redshift-based method allows us to calibrate 
`colour-cut' masses for all 51 clusters in the present sample to a total 
systematic uncertainty of ≈7 per cent on the mean mass, a level 
sufficient to significantly improve current cosmology constraints from 
galaxy clusters. Our results bode well for future cosmological studies 
of clusters, potentially reducing the need for exhaustive spectroscopic 
calibration surveys as compared to other techniques, when deep, 
multifilter optical and near-IR imaging surveys are coupled with robust 
photometric redshift methods.
