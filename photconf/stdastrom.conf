#   NAME
#       astrom configuration file
# 
#   SYNOPSIS
# 
#   FUNCTION
#       This configuration file allows dynamic configuration of the astrom
#       program. The parameters in this file can also be used as command
#       line arguments on the program call.
#       The parameters allowed are the following
#
#
#       - Program screen output:
#            VERBOSE [DEBUG|NORMAL|NONE] directs the programs verbosity
#            if VERBOSE=DEBUG the program will output a map of the background
#            and the corrected image into wo separate fits file in the curr_dir
#       - Program flow control:
#            NITER (INT)      The number of iteration to consecutively run
#                             for the derivation of astromtry. NITER = 1
#                             does not use rejection or outlyers.
#            USE_CG [NO|YES]  Make use of the conjugate gradient algorithm
#                             in the solution. This is a very expensive
#                             but extremely stable method
#            USE_NORMAL [NO|YES]
#                             Make use of the normal equations algorithm
#                             in the solution. It is less stable that CG
#                             but much faster and proves to work fine
#                             in the DENIS case.
#        - Functional descrption:
#            PDEG (INT)       The polynomial degree of the plate distorsion
#                             function. In most cases 2 is sufficient to
#                             describe, for our small area, the deformation.
#            FDEG (IARRAY)    The polynomial desgree of the individual
#                             Chebychev polynomials.

#   The name of several table columns used can be dynamically specified. Those
#   known to the astrom program are:
#   XPOS    - Column name of the x-position object baricenter      [pix]
#   YPOS    - Column name of the y-position object baricenter      [pix]
#   ERRPOS  - Column name of the positional error of baricenter    [pix]
#   XM2     - Column name of the x-direction second order moment   [pix**2]
#   YM2     - Column name of the y-direction second order moment   [pix**2]
#   CORR    - Column name of the second order covariance           [pix**2]
#   CRVAL1  - Column name of the frame right ascension             [deg]
#   CRVAL2  - Column name of the frame declination                 [deg]
#   CDELT1  - Column name of the x-pixel dimension                 [deg]
#   CDELT2  - Column name of the y-pixel dimension                 [deg]
#   CRPIX1  - Column name of the x pixel reference point           [pix]
#   CRPIX2  - Column name of the y pixel reference point           [pix]
#
# XPOS   = Xpos
# YPOS   = Ypos
# ERRPOS = ErrPos
# XM2    = XM2
# YM2    = YM2
# CORR   = Corr
# CRVAL1 = CRVAL1
# CRVAL2 = CRVAL2
# CDELT1 = CDELT1
# CDELT2 = CDELT2
# CRPIX1 = CRPIX1
# CRPIX2 = CRPIX2
#
#   There are two parameters that allow one to correct the possible unit and
#   direction errors that may be present in the CDELT keywords. These are the
#   XPIXSIZE  - CDELT1 scaling parameter                             [float]
#   YPIXSIZE  - CDELT2 scaling parameter                             [float]
#   They scale the values which are recorded in the FITS image headers before
#   the CDELT value is used in the astrometric calibration application. 
#
# XPIXSIZE = 1.0
# YPIXSIZE = 1.0
#
#   To limit the pixel area that is used for the astrometric solution one
#   can specify the corners of the useful image section. In some cases there
#   are, due to vignetting, areas with bad noise characteristics that cause
#   many spurious objects to be cataloged. These suprious objects will mess 
#   up the solution and therefore are removed before astrometric calibration.
#   The corners are given by:
#   XMIN   - Minimum x position of objects allowed        [pix]
#   XMAX   - Maximum x position of objects allowed        [pix]
#   YMIN   - Minimum y position of objects allowed        [pix]
#   YMAX   - Maximum y position of objects allowed        [pix]
#
# XMIN = 15
# XMAX = 753
# YMIN = 10
# YMAX = 758
#
#   The telescope pointing behaviour is can be made known to the astrom program
#   and used to contraint the astrometric solution in addition to the overlap
#   pairing information. Usually a telescope is pointed on a regular grid in
#   rows of overlapping frames. In terms of pixels the resulting frames should
#   be spaced equally and by a given ammount:
#   XSHIFT   - The shifts between consecutive frames in x direction  [pix]
#   YSHIFT   - The shifts between consecutive frames in y direction  [pix]
#
#   The use of these parameters and in fact the use of the above constraining
#   is gouverned by the value of the paramater:
#   USE_ENCODER - Use regular stepping priciples to contrain solution
