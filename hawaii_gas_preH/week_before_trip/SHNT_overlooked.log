** cleanup adam_group2-do_Subaru_preprocess.sh so it's a useful template for later

** ignored the superflat stuff for now! (search USELESS BLOCK)

** 10_2 darks/regs copied right from 2006 run

** 10_2 darks limits weren't changed and WeightMasker.py wasn't used for 10_2 weights, so there might be an issue here

** stuff I did when constructing adam_group2-SUBARU.list:
	names with ZwCl#### might have to be redone later to match their other names starting with Z####
	coordinates given in Equatorial (J2000.0) from ned
	put 0.0 for final column in all
	put other in for all, unless other thing already there
